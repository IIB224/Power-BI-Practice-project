## Problem Statement
This is a project that examines the salaries of data professionals, their favorite programming languages, and various other aspects related to being a data analyst.

### Steps followed 
- Step 1 : Dataset is Excel from Kaggle. 
- Step 2 : Load the data into Power BI and transform the data by using a delimiter to split the yearly salary, then add a filter.
- Step 3 : Eliminate languages or applications that are not completely recognized as programming languages(SQL, Power BI, Tableau).
- Step 4 : Create a bar chart and a column chart to break down the favorite programming languages and salaries.

Happiness with work-life balance
Average age
Count of survey takers

From the data, we can see that the majority of people are using Python, and data scientists are earning the most money compared to other analysts. 
Less than half of the people reported being satisfied with their pay, while just over half indicated that they have a good work-life balance.
